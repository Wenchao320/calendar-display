        <div class="title">The Common Man</div>
        <div class="commentary">Amidst today's news of divisive rhetoric and xenophobic sentiments, "The Common Man" eerily resonates with its portrayal of a peaceful French vacation disrupted by xenophobic comments and a violent clash between locals and immigrant workers. The 1975 film's themes of intolerance and social unrest feel disturbingly relevant. Its release serves as a reminder that some societal issues persist, unchanged.</div>
