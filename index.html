        <div class="commentary">Film Title: The Epitaph Story
Commentary: A nostalgic look at Epitaph Records, a label that once championed punk's anti-establishment ethos. Meanwhile, the establishment continues to crumble, with Trump's antics and ICE's deportation attempts making headlines. It's almost as if the system is begging for a rebellion, but instead, we get tariffs and trade wars. How quaint, a short film about music, while the world burns.</div>
